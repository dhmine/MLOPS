# From Data Processing to Deployment with MLflow

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through a machine learning pipeline, from data processing to deployment, using the powerful MLflow platform. MLflow is an open-source platform that provides a unified way to manage the entire machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. By the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of how to use MLflow.
